Schema files are used by the SetSchemaStep for two thigs:
1. they are copied into the repo and a $schema property is set on targetted json files so that json editors (e.g. VSCode) will offer error checking when editing the json manually.
2. targetted json files are validated against corresponding schemas when packing; any validation errors are displayed to the user as warnings in the console.
